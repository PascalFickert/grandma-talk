# grandma-talk
Talk with grand-mother



Version 1.0 : Added : craps, mexican_fork, rocket-drive, grandma_talk, input_number_between



To talk with grandma : copy this repository on your computer as local ( https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ ), then run grandma_talk.

If you see any problem, make propositions on git (pull-request). Or create new functions, it would be very cool ! :D


Very probably laowantong ( Mr. Grange ) can explain it much better, I hope you all like this new concept to collaborate together, maybe we can continue on this grandma_talk or on another project, it's really exciting ! :D See you soon !
